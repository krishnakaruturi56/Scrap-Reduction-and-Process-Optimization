<h1>Scrap Reduction and Process Optimization</h1>

<h2> Problem Decsription: </h2>
A recurring issue with high scrap rates and increased inspection times for body tube parts—critical sub-assembly components in suspension tubes—led to the exploration of process improvements. The existing saw cutting operation resulted in excessive material wastage, surface damage, and additional inspections, negatively impacting both material costs and production efficiency.

<h2> Challenges:</h2>

1. High Scrap Rate: The saw cutting process generated significant material wastage (9-12%), leading to increased costs of $642.83 per 1000 parts.
2. Increased Inspections: Surface damage from the saw cutting required an additional 2 inspections per part, increasing inspection time by 30-40%, delaying throughput and utilizing more human resources.
3. Surface Damages: 10-12% of parts were unsuitable for assembly due to surface defects, resulting in increased rework, repair, and offline inspections.


<h2> Key Benifits & Improvements:</h2>

- <b>Reduced Scrap: Early detection of insert damage leads to fewer defective parts.</b>
- <b>Extended Tool Life: Predictive tool change capabilities have led to a 25% increase in insert life for half of the inserts, reducing overall tool replacement costs.</b>
- <b>Labor Savings: Elimination of manual inspection removes the need for inspection operators</b>
- <b>Improved Operational Efficiency: Real-time detection and stoppage of the lathe increases production efficiency.</b>
