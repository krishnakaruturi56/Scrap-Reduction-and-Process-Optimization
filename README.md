<h1>Scrap Reduction and Process Optimization</h1>

<h2> Problem Decsription: </h2>
A recurring issue with high scrap rates and increased inspection times for body tube parts, critical sub-assembly components in suspension tubes, led to the exploration of process improvements. The existing saw cutting operation resulted in excessive material wastage, surface damage, and additional inspections, negatively impacting both material costs and production efficiency.

<h2> Challenges:</h2>

1. High Scrap Rate: The saw cutting process generated significant material wastage (9-12%), leading to increased costs of $642.83 per 1000 parts.
2. Increased Inspections: Surface damage from the saw cutting required an additional 2 inspections per part, increasing inspection time by 30-40%, delaying throughput and utilizing more human resources.
3. Surface Damages: 10-12% of parts were unsuitable for assembly due to surface defects, resulting in increased rework, repair, and offline inspections.

<h2> Solution:</h2>
To address these challenges, a 12' bar feeder system was implemented, replacing the saw cutting operation. The bar feeder allows for the raw material to be directly fed into the production process without the intermediary cutting step, optimizing material utilization and preventing surface damage.

<h2> Outcome:</h2>
The transition to the 12' bar feeder system significantly improved the overall production efficiency, reducing scrap, inspection time, and surface defects. These changes resulted in cost savings, improved throughput, and enhanced product quality, addressing the key issues identified in the Non-Conformance Report (NCR).


<h2> Key Benifits & Improvements:</h2>

- <b>Reduced Scrap Rate: Material wastage was reduced by 22%, optimizing material usage and cutting costs.</b>
- <b>Increased Throughput: The removal of cutting operations and reduced defects led to a 14% increase in throughput.</b>
- <b>Labor Savings: Elimination of manual inspection removes the need for inspection operators</b>
- <b>Improved Surface Quality: The new feeding process eliminated surface damage to the Class A appearance of parts, reducing rework and improving cosmetic quality.</b>
