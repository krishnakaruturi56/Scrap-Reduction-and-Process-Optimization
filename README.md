<h1>Scrap Reduction and Process Optimization</h1>

<h2> Problem Decsription: </h2>
A recurring issue with high scrap rates and increased inspection times for body tube parts—critical sub-assembly components in suspension tubes—led to the exploration of process improvements. The existing saw cutting operation resulted in excessive material wastage, surface damage, and additional inspections, negatively impacting both material costs and production efficiency.
